# This is a very client centric view of release engineering.
# We assume our primary product for the community is the client
# libraries and command line interfaces on which specific 
# science applications can be built.
#
# A service is composed of a client and a server, each of which
# should be independently deployable. Clients are composed of
# an application programming interface and a command line
# interface. In our make targets, the deploy-service deploys
# the server, the deploy-client deploys the application
# programming interface libraries, and the deploy-scripts deploys
# the command line interface (usually scripts written in a
# scripting language but java executables also qualify), and the
# deploy target would be equivelant to deploying a service (client
# libs, scripts, and server).
#
# Because the deployment of the server side code depends on the
# specific software module being deployed, the strategy needs
# to be one that leaves this decision to the module developer.
# This is done by having the deploy target depend on the
# deploy-service target. The module developer who chooses for
# good reason not to deploy the server with the client simply
# manages this dependancy accordingly. One option is to have
# a deploy-service target that does nothing, the other is to
# remove the dependancy from the deploy target.
#
# A smiliar naming convention is used for tests.

# library. If it is a client-server module, then it should be
# run against a running server. You can say that this also tests

# to the test-client target if it makes sense to you. This test

# test-client target. You could also add a deploy-service and
